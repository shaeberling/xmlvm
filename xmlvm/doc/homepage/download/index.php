<h1>Download</h1>
<p>
XMLVM is currently hosted at SourceForge. Please visit XMLVM's
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmlvm">project pages</a>
at SourceForge. We do not provide downloadable tar-balls. The only way to
download the source code is via
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=200328">Subversion</a>. We use Eclipse
for development and suggest to use Eclipse to check out the module called
"<tt>xmlvm</tt>" from the Subversion code repository. The sources
contain all necessary libraries required to compile and use XMLVM.
