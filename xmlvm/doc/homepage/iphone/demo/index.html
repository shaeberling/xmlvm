This page features a demo of the Java-to-Objective-C cross-compiler. The demo below
implements a simple fireworks application. The application is written in Java and
can be cross-compiled to run as a native application on the iPhone. Using a
compatibility library to simulate Cocoa, the same application can also be run as a Java applet
which is shown below. The three scroll-bars simulate the iPhone's accelerometer.
The fireworks demo is implemented such that the sparks will always follow gravity,
independent of the orientation of the iPhone. You can also click anywhere on the device's display
to place a bomb.
