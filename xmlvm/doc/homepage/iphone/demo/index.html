<h1>iPhone Simulator</h1>

This page features a demo of the Java-to-Objective-C cross-compiler. The demo below
implements a simple fireworks application. The application is written in Java and
can be cross-compiled to run as a native application on the iPhone. Using a
compatibility library to simulate Cocoa, the same application can also be run as a Java applet
which is shown below. The three scroll-bars simulate the iPhone's accelerometer.
The fireworks demo is implemented such that the sparks will always follow gravity,
independent of the orientation of the iPhone.
