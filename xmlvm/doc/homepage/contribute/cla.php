<p>In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with
Contributions from any person or entity, XMLVM must
have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been
signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms
below.  This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well
as the protection of XMLVM; it does not change your rights to use
your own Contributions for any other purpose.  If you have not already
done so, please complete and send an original signed Agreement to</p>

<p>You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your
present and future Contributions submitted to XMLVM.  Except for the
license granted herein to XMLVM and recipients of software
distributed by XMLVM, You reserve all right, title, and interest in
and to Your Contributions.</p> 
 
<ol> 
 
<li><p>Definitions.  "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner
or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this
Agreement with XMLVM.  For legal entities, the entity making a
Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by,
or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a
single Contributor.  For the purposes of this definition, "control"
means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii)
ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or
(iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.  "Contribution" shall mean
any original work of authorship, including any modifications or
additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You
to XMLVM for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products
owned or managed by XMLVM (the "Work").  For the purposes of this
definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or
written communication sent to XMLVM or its representatives, including
but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source
code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by,
or on behalf of, XMLVM for the purpose of discussing and improving
the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a
Contribution."</p></li> 
 
 
<li><p>Grant of Copyright License.  Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to XMLVM and to
recipients of software distributed by XMLVM a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license
to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such
derivative works.</p></li> 
 
<li><p>Grant of Patent License.  Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, You hereby grant to XMLVM and to recipients of
software distributed by XMLVM a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies
only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily
infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted.  You furthermore agree to notify XMLVM of any patents that
you know or come to know are likely infringed by the Contribution
and/or are not licensable by You.  If any entity institutes patent
litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the
Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory
patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity
under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as
of the date such litigation is filed.</p></li> 
 
<li><p>You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above
license.  If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that
you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you
have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that
employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your
Contributions to XMLVM, or that your employer has executed a separate
Corporate CLA with XMLVM.</p></li> 
 
<li><p>You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).  You
represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details
of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not
limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are
personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your
Contributions.</p></li> 
 
<li><p>You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
except to the extent You desire to provide support.  You may provide
support for free, for a fee, or not at all.  Unless required by
applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions
on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY,
or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p></li> 
 
<li><p>Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original
creation, You may submit it to XMLVM separately from any
Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of
any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to,
related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are
personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on
behalf of a third-party: [named here]".</p></li> 
 
<li><p>You agree to notify XMLVM of any facts or circumstances of
which you become aware that would make these representations
inaccurate in any respect.</p></li>
