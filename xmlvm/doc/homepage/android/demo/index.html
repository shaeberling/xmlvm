<h1>Xokoban</h1>

This page features a demo of the Android-to-iPhone cross-compiler. The demo below
implements a version of the classic Sokoban game called Xokoban within XMLVM. The
application was originally written for Android using the Android-specific API. By
using the Android Compatibility Library as well as XMLVM's Java API for Cocoa it
is possible to run Xokoban on an iPhone or on XMLVM's own Java-based iPhone
emulator. The latter is shown below through an applet. You can play the game by
making swipes on the device screen with the mouse. Read the instructions given
in the info-dialog for more information. Xokoban has been released in Apple's
AppStore as well the Android Market. Note: this applet may not work in some browsers.
