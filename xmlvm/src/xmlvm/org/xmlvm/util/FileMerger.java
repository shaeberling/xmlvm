/**
 * This is a utility function to merge two files. It is not a traditional
 * merging tool, though. Instead it uses files that have section which are
 * described by special XMLVM markup.
 * <p>
 * Sections start with {@code //XMLVM_BEGIN} and end with {@code //XMLVM_END}.
 * These markers have to be the first non-whitespace characters on the line.
 * They can be followed by an arbitrary string, which is ignored for the end
 * marker. For the begin marker though this trailing string is a key for this
 * section. Sections must have unique keys within one file.
 * <p>
 * This utility takes file pairs which are merged like this: All sections are
 * extracted from the source and destination file and stored with their key. If
 * a section is contained in both source- and destination file then the contents
 * of the section in the source file replace the contents of that same section
 * in the destination file.
