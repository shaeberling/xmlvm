/**
 * This is the classic "Hello World" application for iOS. The entry point is the
 * usual <code>main()</code> method of any Java application. Note that an
 * application should only contain one <code>main()</code>. The only thing
 * usually done in <code>main()</code> is to call
 * <code>UIApplication.main()</code> which passes control to iOS and will launch
 * the application. Note that <code>UIApplication.main()</code> never returns.
 * The last argument passed to <code>UIApplication.main()</code> is the class
 * object of the application delegate. iOS will instantiate the delegate (class
 * <code>HelloWorld</code> in this case) and invoke the callback
 * <code>applicationDidFinishLaunching()</code> that serves as main entry point
 * of any iOS application. All the API used in this and subsequent example is
 * compliant with the official iOS API.
