<!-- 
The XML-attribute 'text' of tag <TextView> does not contain a string literal, but rather
a reference to a string defined in strings.xml. Depending on the local settings of the
device, the file strings.xml is read from different directories. The name of the
directory contains the two letter country code by which different locales can be
distinguished. Prefix "@string" designates a string resource to be looked up in
strings.xml. The suffix 'greeting' designates a symbolic label used to identify
the particular string.
