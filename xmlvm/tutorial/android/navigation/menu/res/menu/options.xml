This file describes the items of the options menu. This particular menu
has three items: Add, Delete, and Search. For each item a resource ID is
created so it can be referenced from the implementation. For each item,
a label (XML attribute 'title') and an icon (XML attribute 'icon') is
defined. The icons refer to standard Android icons that are available
to any Android application. However, Android documentation recommends copying
these resources to the project using the resource since the appearance may
change from version to version. So the referenced drawables are made part of
this application.
